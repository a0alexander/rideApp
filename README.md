# rideApp
This app was designed for enabling users on campus to ride share with other colleagues in their campus.
Originally developed in Dec 2019 | Posted in 2020

This app is designed to enable students/teachers of the campus to find a ride share home. They can search for users who are travelling to a destination near their houses
and request to ride share with 'driver' user. Additionally, drivers can mark where they are going and the route. The app matches locations based on the route so a user can 
decide if they want to get off on the way as well.
